    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy explains how Ask Samer collects, uses, and protects your personal data when you use this website and when you book and pay for a 1:1 call.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect and process only what is necessary to run the website and deliver the booked service:</p>

      <li><strong>Payment details (via Stripe through Calendly):</strong> Payment status and transaction metadata (e.g., amount, currency, time, and a payment reference). We do <strong>not</strong> receive or store your full card details.</li>
      <li><strong>Website usage / server logs:</strong> Technical information such as IP address, browser type, and pages visited (standard GitHub Pages server logs).</li>
      <li><strong>Email communication:</strong> If you contact us by email, we process the content of your message and any data you provide.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Purpose and Legal Basis (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>We process personal data for the following purposes and legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To provide the booked service</strong> (scheduling, preparing, and holding the call) — Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract / steps prior to entering a contract).</li>
      <li><strong>To process payments</strong> — Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (contract) and Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR (legal obligations, e.g., tax and accounting where applicable).</li>
      <li><strong>To respond to inquiries</strong> — Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (pre-contractual steps) or Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in handling communication).</li>
      <li><strong>To maintain and secure the website</strong> (technical operation, abuse prevention) — Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following service providers to operate the website and deliver bookings/payments:</p>
    <ul>
